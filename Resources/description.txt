Death In The Wild: A S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2 Overhaul

Inspired by The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, every weapon and armor piece you find is finite. There are no repairs, no purchases, and no selling! This system turns STALKER 2 into a more tactical and immersive survival experience, where every choice matters and exploration is its own reward.

Weapons and armor are acquired by defeating enemies or scavenging the Zone. Once they wear out, they’re gone, forcing you to adapt and make strategic choices. Without the ability to sell or repair gear, you spend less time running back to town and more time exploring the Zone, uncovering secrets, and surviving encounters with what you find.

Here are the main features:
- Weapons and armors have reduced durability wear
- NPCs now always drop armor
- Mutants always drop mutant loot

- Consumables, quest Items and artifacts weigh nothing
- Artifacts no longer "run" from you
- More weapons can be equipped in the pistol slot
